🎬 Movie Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The system leverages both Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering techniques to enhance accuracy and relevance in recommendations.

🚀 Features

Content-Based Filtering: Uses movie metadata such as genres, cast, and keywords to recommend similar movies.

Collaborative Filtering: Analyzes user ratings and preferences to suggest movies liked by similar users.

Hybrid Recommendation: Combines both methods for improved performance.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, cleans movie metadata, and normalizes data for better model accuracy.

Cosine Similarity & Matrix Factorization: Implements similarity metrics and latent factor models for predictions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms: Cosine Similarity, User-Item Matrix Factorization, SVD

📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Load and preprocess dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and patterns.

Content-Based Filtering – Recommend movies based on metadata similarity.

Collaborative Filtering – Predict ratings using user-item interactions.

Hybrid Model – Merge both techniques for better accuracy.

Evaluation – Measure performance using metrics like RMSE and Precision@K.

🎯 Outcomes

Provides personalized recommendations tailored to user preferences.

Enhances understanding of recommender system algorithms.

Practical implementation of data preprocessing, similarity measures, and model evaluation.
